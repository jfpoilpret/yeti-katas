This repository contains Yeti code that implements some katas.

The first kata implemented is FooBarQix (http://www.code-story.net/2011/11/16/foobarqix.html).

Each yeti source file is normally autonomous, i.e. it doesn't depend on any module (besides Yeti standard modules).

Each file contains its own module and can be directly loaded in Yeti REPL, e.g.:

	load foobarqix

Or it can be directly launched from the command line, e.g.:

	java -jar yeti.jar -e "load foobarqix"
	
provided yeti.jar is in the same directory as the loaded module (source file).
